NUMBER 1:
    forget to include UVM library in tb.sv file or list.sv file: 
        `include "uvm_pkg.sv"
        `include "uvm_macros.svh"
NUMBER 2: 
    mismatches among variables' names
NUMBER 3:
    mistakenly type wrong detailed path of virtual interface in uvm_config_db command
      uvm_config_db#(virtual interface axi_intf #(DW, AW1))::set(null, "uvm_test_top.m_env0.axi_agent_master*", "m_vif", AXI);
      uvm_config_db#(virtual interface apb_intf #(DW, AW2))::set(null, "uvm_test_top.m_env0.apb_agent_slave*", "s_vif", APB);
    SPECIFICALLY: MUST PAY ATTENTION TO "uvm_test_top.m_env0.axi_agent_master" and "...apb_agent_slave" 
NUMBER 4: 
    forget to initialize handles => BAD or NULL HANDLES
    for instance:
        (1)
        + only do apb_seq_item ApbPacket
        + do not initialize: ApbPacket = apb_seq_item::type_id::create("...");
        (2)
        + fastidiously check the status of queue before reading it
NUMBER 5: 
    carefully hande while(1) loop
        + should use full block if-else, avoid to use only if without else => wait infinite loop
NUMBER 6:
    in Monitor class, when using LOOP to capture valid data, sequence_item MUST BE MADE after each transfer 
    to avoid DATA LOSS (override mechanism). As usual, sequence_item only created in build_phase() task ONCE
NUMBER 7:
    driver and monitor synchorization
    (1) DRIVER: @(posedge clk)
            a = value; //proper form is: a <= value
    (2) MONITOR: @(posedge clk)
            if(b && a) begin
            end
    from (1) and (2) monitor never captures valid value of a
NUMBER 8: 
    we must not use new() method to initialize config object
NUMBER 9:
    BE CAREFUL to use uvm_object_utils and uvm_object_param_utils in UVM factory registration
